# RestoreWindowsUpdatev6
In this repository you can find a way to completely restore Windows Update on older Windows (from 2000)

# Notes
This method requires you to use a server.
I suggest Windows Server 2016 or newer.
Windows 10 and 11 work well anyway.
There isn't any patch to apply on the clients, they need only the proxy.

# Important
This method requires not to use the latest Windows Update Agent.
If you want to use it, please follow MSDN method (but Automatic Updates will be limited)
